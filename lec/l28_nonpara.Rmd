The authors of the study and outside experts stressed that such tau imaging is far from a diagnostic test for C.T.E., which is likely years away and could include other markers, from blood and spinal fluid.

The results of the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, are considered preliminary, but constitute a first step toward developing a clinical test to determine the presence of C.T.E. in living players, as well as early signs and potential risk.


### From the article
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Between-group comparisons of age, years of education, and MMSE scores were analyzed with **Mann–Whitney U tests**. Group differences in race were analyzed with the use of chi-square tests. For between-group comparisons of amyloid-beta plaque burden, chi-square tests were used to compare the proportion of participants with a positive florbetapir PET, and **t-tests** were used to compare the mean cortical:cerebellar florbetapir standard uptake value ratio (SUVR, the ratio of radioactivity in a cerebral region to that in the cerebellum as a reference) between the groups.

### Roadmap
In part III :

- One sample comparison to a mean (one sample t)
- Two independent samples (two sample t)
- Two non-independent samples (paired t)
- Multiple samples/groups (ANOVA)
  - Bonferroni
  - Tukey's HSD


### Roadmap
But all of the methods we have looked at so far depend on some assumptions about the underlying distribution.

What have we assumed?

What do we do if our assumptions are violated?
  
## Non-Parametric testing

### Non-Parametric Testing
From http://biostatisticsryangoslingreturns.tumblr.com/
```{r nonpara, fig.align='center', out.width="40%", echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("nonpara.png")
```


### Non-Parametric Testing
**PROS**: Non-parametric methods make very few assumptions about the variable(s) we samples or their distribution and thus rely less on “parameters”.

- They do not use means or standard deviations
- Use a ranking of the data instead of actual values
- Do not assume a normal distribution of the data
- Less sensitive to outliers and skewed data
- Do not need a large sample size

**CONS**: Non-parametric methods use less of the information offered in the data

- If the assumptions of for a parametric test are met and a non-parametric test is used, it will have lower power (probability of detecting a false null hypothesis)
- They are less specific in what they test
- They in essence ignore important parts of the data


### Non-Parametric Testing
We will discuss non-parametric equivalents for:

Two sample t :  Wilcoxon Rank-Sum

Paired t : Wilcoxon sign-rank

ANOVA:  Kruskal Wallis

## Wilcoxon two-sample tests

### Frank Wilcoxon
```{r wilcox, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("wilcox.png")
```

In one paper in 1945 he proposed both the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
- Sometimes also called the Mann-Whitney U test
- Non-parametric test for comparing two independent samples with a continuous outcome
- This is the non-parametric counterpart of the two sample t-test 
- Assumes that the distributions have the same general shape but assumes nothing about that shape.  
- Evaluates the null hypothesis that the two populations are identical.

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
To calculate a rank sum test

The observations are ordered from lowest to highest and assigned the **rank** of their order.  

If there are "tie" values, these are assigned the average of the ranks, ie if two observations have the same value and the next lower value is rank=3 then the two observations are both given the rank of 4.5 (because they would have been ranks 4 and 5).  

Then the sums of ranks belonging to group 1 are compared to the sums of ranks belonging to group 2


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
Values in group 1:  4,3,5,2,6

Values in group 2:  6,5,7,4,8

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum

|Group 1 |rank  |  Group 2 | rank       |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------|
|4        |3.5    |6              | 7.5        |
|3        |2      |5              | 5.5        |
|5        |5.5    |7              | 9          |
|2        |1      |4              |3.5         |
|6        |7.5    |8              |10          |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------|
|sum      | 19.5    | sum              |35.5   |

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
The smaller of the two sums is called W.  This is then used in the following equation to generate a Z statistic.

$$Z_{w}=\frac{W-\mu_w}{\sigma_{w}}$$
where

$$\mu_w=\frac{n_s(n_s+n_l+1)}{2}$$
and

$$\sigma_{w}=\sqrt{\frac{n_sn_l(n_s+n_l+1)}{12}}$$

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
So from our example where group 1 had a rank sum of 19.5 and group 2 had a rank sum of 35.5

$$\mu_w=\frac{n_s(n_s+n_l+1)}{2}=\frac{5(5+5+1)}{2}=27.5$$
and

$$\sigma_{w}=\sqrt{\frac{n_sn_l(n_s+n_l+1)}{12}}=\sqrt{\frac{5*5(5+5+1)}{12}}=4.8$$

$$Z_{w}=\frac{W-\mu_w}{\sigma_{w}}=\frac{19.5-27.5}{4.8}=-1.67$$

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum
The $Z_{w}$ we generate follows an approximate standard normal distribution.
So we can use our Z score to get a p-value in R
```{r, echo=TRUE}
2*pnorm(-1.67)
```


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum in R

The general syntax will be:

wilcox.test(group1, group2, paired=F)

or 

wilcox.test(outcome ~ group, paired=F)

remember that you can always type help(wilcox.test) in your console to get the full details


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum example :phenylketonuria 
Normalized mental age scores for children with phenylketonuria

Group 1:  "low exposure" < 10.0 mg/dl

Group 2:  "high exposure" >= 10.0 mg/dl


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum :phenylketonuria 
```{r read pku, echo=FALSE}
nMA<- c(34.5, 37.5, 39.5, 40,45.5, 47,47,47.5,48.7, 49, 51,51,52,53,54,54,55,56.5,57,58.5,58.5,28,35,37,37,43.5,44,45.5,46,48,48.3,48.7,51,52,53,53,54,54,55)
Group<-c((rep("low",21)),rep("high",18))

pku <- data.frame(Group,nMA)
head(pku)
```


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum :phenylketonuria 
In this example there 18 High and 21 Low exposure individuals.
```{r}
group_by(pku,Group) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    median = median(nMA, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR = IQR(nMA, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum: PKU
If we graph the distributions with a density plot what do we notice?
```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(pku, aes(x = nMA)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = Group), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum: PKU
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=F, warning=FALSE}
wilcox.test(nMA ~ Group, data=pku,paired=F)
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T : NHANES example
Here I will again use the NHANES data as an example, looking at height by gender
```{r read, echo=TRUE}
# Read CSV into R
nhanes <- read.csv(file="nhanes.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
names(nhanes)
```


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T : NHANES example
```{r wil1, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(bmxht~gender,data=nhanes, main="Height in cm by gender")
malesht <- nhanes$bmxht[nhanes$gender=="Male"]
femalesht <- nhanes$bmxht[nhanes$gender=="Female"]
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T
```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = bmxht)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill=gender), alpha=0.1) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T
```{r wil2, echo=TRUE}
t.test(malesht, femalesht, paired=F)
```


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T
```{r wilvst, echo=TRUE}
wilcox.test(malesht,femalesht,paired=F)
```


### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum vs T
When the sample size is quite large (as with these NHANES data)  the assumption of approximate normality is reasonable one and the results of the hypothesis testing will generally not be different using a parametric or non-parametric approach.


## Wilcoxon sign rank

### Wilcoxon Sign rank
- Non-parametric test for comparing two non-independent (paired) sample means
- This is the non-parametric counterpart of the paired t-test
- Assumes that the distributions have the same general shape but assumes nothing about that shape.  
- Evaluates the null hypothesis that the difference between the first and second measures is 0.

### Wilcoxon Sign rank
Steps:

1) Calculate the difference between each pair of observations 

2) Rank the difference by absolute value from smallest to largest (again, tie values get the average of the ranks).  Any pair where difference = 0 is thrown out.

3) Assign a "sign" for whether the difference was positive or negative

4) Take the sum of the positive ranks and the sum of the negative ranks (the smaller sum is denoted with a T).  


### Wilcoxon Sign rank
Under the null hypothesis that the difference is 0, we would expect the sample to have equal numbers of positive and negative ranks with equivalent sums.  This expectation is tested against the statistic
$$Z_{T}=\frac{T-\mu_{T}}{\sigma_{T}}$$

Where
$$\mu_{T}=\frac{n(n+1)}{4}$$
and 
$$\sigma_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{24}}$$


### Wilcoxon Sign rank:  Example Pre and post test
```{r sign, echo=FALSE}
Change<-c(12,13,-2,-1,10,-3,-1,13,-1,-2,20,28,0)
test1<-c(65,87,77,90,70,84,92,83,85,91,68,72,81)
test2<-c(77,100,75,89,80,81,91,96,84,89,88,100,81)
prepost<-data.frame(Change,test1,test2)
```

  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

|70       |80    |10  |+|7|

|68       |88   |20  |+|12|
|---------|------|----|------|

Sum of the positive sign ranks is 57


### Wilcoxon Sign rank:  Example
Our expectation would be 
$$\mu_{T}=\frac{n(n+1)}{4}=\frac{12(12+1)}{4}=39$$
**remember that we had 13 observations, but we dropped one because the scores at times 1 and 2 were the same**
and 
$$\sigma_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{24}}=\sqrt{\frac{12(12+1)(2*12+1)}{24}}=12.75$$

### Wilcoxon Sign rank:  Example
And we compare our expectation to the smaller rank value (Sum of negative ranks was 21, sum of positive ranks was 57)
$$Z_{T}=\frac{T-\mu_{T}}{\sigma_{T}}=\frac{21-39}{12.75}=-1.412$$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2*pnorm(-1.412)
```

### Wilcoxon Rank-Sum in R

The general syntax will be:

wilcox.test(group1, group2, paired=T)

or 

wilcox.test(outcome ~ group, paired=T)


### Wilcoxon Sign rank:  Example

```{r, sign2, echo=TRUE}
wilcox.test(test1,test2,paired=T, correct=FALSE)
```

### Wilcox Sign rank: compare to T
```{r spairt,echo=TRUE}
t.test(test1,test2,paired=TRUE)
```

### Wilcox Sign rank:  Compare to T
With this study, our sample is 13 and the distribution of changes looks like this - remember that the 0 difference value gets thrown out of sign rank test:
```{r wtot, echo=TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
hist(Change)
```



## Non-parametric test for three or more samples

### Kruskal Wallis
The Kruskal Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to the ANOVA test 
Kruskal-Wallis looks at the medians of the groups, not the means and tests if at least one is significantly different from another (but not which one)
- $H_{0}$: There is no difference between the group medians
- $H_{1}$: There is a statically significant difference in the group medians

### Kruskal Wallis
This test can be thought of as an extension of the rank sum test as it is based on the Rank-sum test.
We will not do this one by hand.  
In R the syntax is generally:

kruskal.test(outcome ~ group, dataset)

### Kruskal Wallis
```{r, echo=FALSE}
##students you could tinker with this code to see what happens if you add outliers, or shift the outcomes for a group
treatment <- c(rep("Group1", 4), rep("Group2", 5), rep("Group3", 6), rep("Group4", 7))
outcome <- c(30, 46, 99, 95,  # group1
                  3, 14, 16, 41, 47, #group2
                  5, 4, 4, 4, 10, 9, #group3
                  24, 30, 43, 51, 62, 32, 96 ) #group4 

KW_data <- data.frame(treatment, outcome)
kruskal.test(outcome~ treatment, data=KW_data)
```

### Non parametric summary

Most parametric tests have an analogous non-parametric test
We have covered the following:

|Samples |Parametric | Non Parametric       |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Two independent samples   | two sample ttest       | Wilcoxon rank sum|
| Two paired samples        | paired ttest |  Wilcoxon sign rank      |
| Three or more samples     | ANOVA     | Kruskal Wallis |

### Non parametrics in R


|Samples |test name | R function       |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Two independent samples   |  Wilcoxon rank sum| wilcox.test(group1,group2,paired=F) |
| Two paired samples        | Wilcoxon sign rank      | wilcox.test(group1,group2,paired=T) |
| Three or more samples     |  Kruskal Wallis | kruskal.test(outcome ~ group) |
